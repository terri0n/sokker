faq.answer4    = <p>For direct training, only the skill you train from the main coach is taken into account. If this is unearthly, the training will be 100% effective, losing 6.25% for every point missing from the skill. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For general training, the average of the skill in question of the main coach is taken into account with the sum of levels of the assistants divided by 3. If this resulting level is unearthly, the training will be 100% effective, losing 6.25% for every point missing it turns out. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Sokker Asistente</i> does not settle for using the visible level of the assistants but rather pretends to be as accurate as possible.

faq.answer5    = <p><i>Sokker Asistente</i> cannot know the exact values used during the training, but instead reads the data stored in <i>Sokker</i> the first time it is updated after the training is performed. So, if you make any changes in this period, your training data could be wrong.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, there is a particular case with injuries: when a player has 7 days of injury, <i>Sokker Asistente</i> cannot know if he has received the training or not, since it depends on the decimals of the injury, and that information is not provided by the <i>Sokker</i> interface. If your player has received training but <i>Sokker Assistant</i> has not counted him, you can modify the training and set "6" as the player's injury days. In this way the training will be taken as completed.</p>
faq.answer6    = <p>It works differently from other training types, since it is independent of the minutes played by each player. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every week, all players receive a fixed amount of stamina training which, as I said before, is about 10% of direct training. But, at the same time, each player can randomly lose a quantity of stamina each week. When lost, this amount is greater than the 10% received, so there are times when players lose a level of stamina the week after it has raised. Over a season, the amount lost is approximately 50% of what is trained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it would be almost impossible to know what actual amount of stamina is trained each week, <i>Sokker Asistente</i> makes an approximation, counting each general stamina training as 5% of the direct training. You can get an idea of \u200B\u200Bhow much you have left to raise each player knowing that 100% is equivalent to a complete training, and that a player can go up a full level with approximately 80% trained. Therefore, when you train stamina, there may be players who raise 2 hit levels and, in general, each player raises a full level of stamina per season (with good coach and assistants). But, at best, if you are lucky enough to never lose training, you could go up a full level in 8 weeks.</p>\r\n
faq.answer7    = <p>Talent is the number of weeks a player needs to go up a full level in youth school with a good youth coach. This number is not accurate, in part because there is an important randomness, but the more weeks the calculation is made, the smaller the margin of error we make.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the talent of the school corresponds roughly to the double of weeks that a 17-year-old player would need to pop in pace or striker to weak, or defending, technique, playmaker or passing to adequate, provided you have good coaches and assistants. Each level of more supposes approximately 9.4% of increase with respect to the previous level, and each year of more also, with which, once we know how many trainings we need to raise a certain level, we can calculate all the others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there is no randomness here, there is a margin of error because we can only see the integer value of each skill. Again, the more data we have, the better talent can be limited.</p>\r\n
faq.answer8    = <p>This graph shows the value of the player processed with the intention of eliminating the effect of changes in form on the value. This way you can analyze if a player has been training or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this we find the value proportionally, given the fact that a player with a tragic form will have 55% of the value he would have with a superdivine form.</p>\r\n
