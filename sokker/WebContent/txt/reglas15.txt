On entering the list of your matches, you can find a link Match Orders next to the matches not yet played. It leads to the page allowing you to select players for a given match determine their orders and choose the right tactics. The view of the tactics shows the average position of the players and may appear slightly different to what you see in the tactics editor. Select your 16 players (first 11 plus 5 substitutes) by selecting their names against positions 1 to 16. make sure that you do not have more than 1 GK, 5 DEF, 5 MID and 3 STR. Then choose the tactics and click on Save. You will see the page with the selected line-up again. Remember to check that the line-up has been saved, by leaving the line-up editor and then checking it again. Some browsers may generate errors.

Editing the tactics

The tactics editor can be found in the Training file, or on the Line-up editing page. You can only edit your own tactics, if you do not have any you will need to copy one of the existing tactics. To do this, use the Create new tactics based on: dropdown and choose a tactic that will be a basis to the new line-up from the list. Then you should choose a name, so it is easy for you to find. Upon clicking on Create, the user tactics will be displayed under the standard ones. Above the tactics editor, the tactic name is displayed.

Select the tactic that you want to edit. It will then appear in the football pitch to the right. To alter the tactics, “drag” the ball in the centre of the field with your mouse pointer by pressing the left mouse button. You will see how the players move around the pitch. They will do the same on the pitch provided their pace and stamina will allow them to. The current position of the ball indicates how the players should be lined up at the moment. If you want to change the line-up, simply “drop” the ball in the chosen place and place the players in the desired positions. Pay attention to whether your players change their positions smoothly with the moving ball. Improper line-up may cause that your players would not be able to reach their positions on time, making your tactics useless.
You decide yourself on the style of play that your team delivers, e.g. decide how far defenders can go during offensive actions, placing the players wide or closer to the centre of the pitch, thereby strengthening or weakening selected parts of the field etc. There are millions of potential combinations for you to use!

On pages with players’ line-up for the match and with the individual marks, the view of the applied tactics is generated. Do not be surprised if this view differs significantly from that you can see after opening you tactics in the editor as this highlights the average position of each player.
